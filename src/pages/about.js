                  Hello there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. My
                  name's Priyanga Vanangamudi. I'm a front-end developer by
                  profession but also a book reader, an avid photographer, a
                  wanderess and I'm also into learning foreign languages. I'm a
                  curious developer passionate about new and exciting
                  technologies.
                </p>
                <p className='animate-left'>
                  I started my career as a software intern with no relevant
                  background experience or degree and gradually moved on to web
                  development. I always loved JavaScript, and I had spent most
                  of my career on UI and client side technologies. I enjoy
                  creating things that focus on usefulness and elegance.
                </p>
                <p className='animate-left'>
                  I have developed projects for many companies worldwide and
                  local, both independently and in teams, cooperating with other
                  developers and designers. When dealing with a project I pay
                  attention to the smallest details addressing problems with
                  patience. I love teaching people to code and Iâ€™ve learned a
                  lot of cool stuff. But I am still in the endless journey of
                  learning new things.
